I asked for fresh towels per the sign on the bathroom mirror, and was told that housekeeping only comes in on Mondays. Additionally, I was told I can come to the front desk and get some towels there. No one offered to bring towels to my room. It was a you want it, you come and get it. So at 7:00 pm, I came to an empty front desk and stood there for awhile. Called the number for someone with no answer. Finally found towels myself on the front desk. What has happened to hospitality? I’m not too good to get myself some towels, but no effort was made at all to show any kind of hospitality. Sign on the front says if you are unhappy for any reason a refund will be given. I’d love to hear from hotel management. Also, I must have not been the only one requesting towels, as our hotel hallway was lined with dirty towels outside of peoples rooms. Looks like I wasn’t the only one. …",
La Quinta Inn by Wyndham - The Woodlands North,781611594,21-Jan,30,311,/Profile/HonestReviews4U31,64,"Chicago, Illinois",5,21-Jan,2/19/21,,,20,,,,,TX,USA,2021,"From a safety issue, I'd probably avoid this hotel.  The only room access that I could see is via the outside. In other words, there is no entry via the lobby, which could be locked and only persons with room keys could enter the building after a certain time at night.  ln other words; There is no central hallway inside the hotel in order to access rooms. You enter your room from the outside, so anyone outside could possibly kick-in your door.  I had literally just got out of the hospital and accessing a room was going to be challenging due to an injured leg in a walking cast.  In short: I advised the clerk that due to my injury, I needed to go to another La Quinta, and asked if she would transfer my reservation to another local hotel.  She said she could not and for me to cancel the current reservation, I had to call Wyndham Hotels customer service.  After speaking with 2 people in customer service, I was advised that the clerk had not cancelled my reservation and that I was going to get charged for one night. Customer service advised that the clerk could cancel the reservation with no charge if she wanted to cancel it.  I had to go back to the hotel, and after a terse discussion related to my medical challenges and their hotel's layout challenges for me to even access a room, the reservation was cancelled with no charge.  Be forewarned: With Wyndham, their franchise hotels to do NOT have one standard reservation policy.  Each hotel gets to, ""make their own rules"" as it pertains to customer service and reservations.  Once the reservation was cancelled with no charge, I went to the La Quinta in Spring, TX nearby and got a handicapped access room that I could easily enter and exit.  NOTE: Had the clerk at this hotel treated me decently, I would have considered staying there in the future once my injured leg healed, Yet, based on how I was treated, I won't stay there. Ever.…","Thank you for your review. I'm sorry to here you had such a frustrating experience, but I really appreciate you bringing this issue to my attention."

When we checked in, I noticed the room rate was more than the amount on my email.  I showed the lady at the front desk my email and she said that she would have the manager fix the rate and she would bring me my paper to sign.  When she brought me the paper, it was still the wrong amount and I told her I would not sign that.  She said she would get the manager to fix it and I could sign it before I checked out.  When I went to check out, the manager had put a sticky note on my room rate paper saying that the rate I was quoted was for a single King bed, not two beds.  I again, showed another lady at the front desk my email that quoted my room with two queen beds for the reduced price.  I was told the manager was not there but to call at lunch time and the problem would be fixed.  I called and the person who answered the phone told me the problem was fixed and the difference on the room would be refunded.  I checked my credit card online and not only was the wrong price for the room charged, I also had the price that was supposed to be refunded charged twice and refunded once.  So the total amount charged for my room was doubled from what it was supposed to be.  I called the hotel and talked to the manager and he was the rudest man I have ever spoken with in my life!!  I have called the General Manager of Choice Hotels and they are fixing the problem.  NEVER go to this hotel!!!…",
